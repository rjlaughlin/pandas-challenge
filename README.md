## Overview

This repository contains a Python script designed to analyze school performance data using **Pandas** and **Jupyter Notebook**. 

## Features

### District Summary
The script aggregates district-wide data and provides key metrics such as:
- Total number of schools
- Total number of students
- Total district budget
- Average math and reading scores
- Percentage of students passing math and reading
- Overall passing percentage (students passing both subjects)

### School Summary
The script calculates and presents performance metrics for each school:
- School name and type
- Total student count
- School budget and per-student spending
- Average math and reading scores
- Percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall

### Highest and Lowest-Performing Schools
The script identifies the top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rates.

### Performance by Grade
Average math and reading scores are calculated for each grade level (9th to 12th) across all schools.

### Scores by Spending
School performance is broken down by per-student spending ranges, including:
- Average scores in math and reading
- Percentage of students passing math and reading
- Overall passing percentage

### Scores by School Size
The script analyzes performance based on school size categories (small, medium, large) and calculates average scores and passing percentages.

### Scores by School Type
School performance is summarized by school type (public, charter), showing the average scores and passing rates.
